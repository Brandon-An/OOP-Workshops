A function that has an in parameter passed to it does not return said parameter. Our display function is an example of a function with an in parameter, as it has a record passed into it, but makes no modifications to it and does not return it to the caller. An out parameter is given to a function for it to manipulate and return to the caller. In our program there is one load function that crated a dynamic array which then passes that array to another load function so that it can be filled. The passed array is an out parameter. It is received by the second function and returned to the first. In and out parameters are distinct from the return values of non-void functions because the parameter itself is being returned, instead of an integer or character, as with an int or char function.
